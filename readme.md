This is a simple React web application to generate data objects for svg elements displayed in a Gallery

These are the steps to reproduce in order to create the the data objects necessaries to fill the svg with the data

In the terminal

Run "npm run jsx" to convert the .jsx to js in the src folder
Run "npm run svg" to write the data objects in the client/data/svgs.js where the data are consumed
Run "npm build" to start the WebPack build
